## Workflow
1. **Preliminaries and Planning**
> Brainstorming session to find potentially useful features to-be-included in the final product <br>
> Assigning member roles based on said modules <br>
> Utilizing external tools to track progress of development (i.e. Motion, etc.) <br>
> Creation of Django project titled "MID Tourism" <br>
> Initial deployment of Heroku app <br>

2. **Assuring functionality of each feature**

> Creating a branch for each module in the Django project <br>
> Implementing the models, views, templates, and forms for each module (ala requirements) <br>
> Making dummy data for testing, and Django tests for coverage <br>
> Ensuring that each app works in its own isolated environment <br>
> Utilizing AJAX principles to implement asynchronous programming into each app when possible <br>

3. **Interconnecting the apps**
> Creating a "homepage" that unites every app into one centralized place for easy access <br>
> Coding new views so the homepage can access every app via hyperlink <br>
> Developing 2 users: Customer and Admin; difference being Customer has no authorization beyond viewing, and Admin has various authorizations <br>
> Merging every app into one branch "Staging"; dealing with any merge errors <br>

4. **UI/UX Design**
> Utilizing external apps to design the design for each app and the homepage (i.e. Figma) <br>

5. **UI/UX Implementation**
> Using CSS frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap to implement the design made in the earlier steps <br>
> Merging again into Staging to deal with potential merging errors and fixing every encounter <br>

6. **Deployment**
> Pushing "Staging" to Main
> Deploy to Heroku
